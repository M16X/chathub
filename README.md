# Xulux Grok Style Assistant

A Grok-inspired assistant surface with minimal dark styling, center composer, icon branding, message actions, and concise controls.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local` for live AI responses. Without a key, `app/api/chat/route.ts` returns a deterministic fallback response so the demo still runs locally. Thread history runs in memory and resets on reload; set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL` to an assistant-cloud project URL to persist threads and generate titles.

Source demo: `apps/docs/components/pages/examples/grok.tsx`
